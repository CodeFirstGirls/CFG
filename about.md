These notes are incomplete - this is the backbone made using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

[Code First: Girls](http://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) is a social enterprise which runs free coding courses for young women who are either aged between 18-23 or are currently uni students/have graduated in the past 2 years.

Courses usually run one evening each week for two hours, the beginners HTML/CSS is 6 weeks long and our advanced courses (Ruby or Python) are 8 weeks. There'll also be some socials and potentially a few guest speaker talks as well.
